- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan (@Ryan-Pro-1)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, mainly using R, for data analysis and econometrics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in a Master's program for economics and seeking out entry-level employment for when I am finished. Further, I am trying to branch out and bridge the gap between the theory we learn in school and real-world applications.
